# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Case-Study-1
In this repository, I present my version of analysis to the Case Study 1 Capstone Project of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) program.:smiley:<br><br>
I show the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act to uncover how a bike-sharing company might design a new marketing strategy for future success utilizing their existing data.
