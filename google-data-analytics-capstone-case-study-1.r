The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,\nyour team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n\n<a id=\"subsection-two\"></a>\n#### Characters and Teams\n* Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.\n* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n* Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.\n* Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.\n\n<a id=\"subsection-three\"></a>\n#### About the Company\nIn 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and\nreturned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.\nOne approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\nCyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic\nprogram and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.\nMoreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-three\"></a>\n# Ask\nIn this phase, I seek to understand the specific problem I am to solve, referred to as the business task, as well as how my insights will benefit the business after considering stakeholders involved. I went on to tease out the hypothesis in order to effectively communicate findings along those lines.\n\n<a id=\"subsection-four\"></a>\n#### Hypothesis\nCyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing believes that increasing the number of yearly memberships is critical to Cyclistic's future success. \n\n<a id=\"subsection-five\"></a>\n#### Business Task\nAnalyze the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently by identifying trends in the data.\n\n<a id=\"subsection-six\"></a>\n#### Objective\nDevelop new marketing strategies from findings to convert casual riders into annual members, increasing the company's profitability by a significant margin.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-four\"></a>\n# Prepare\nThe raw data for this project was obtained using the <a id=\"subsection-seven\"></a>[link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to the data as provided by Google under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).\n\nThe data is open to the public. All data is organized in .csv file format, with some metadata in .txt files attached. The data is delivered in batches of months, each named in a \"year-month\" style. Each monthly csv file contains data organized into about thirteen columns, containing information about each ride and trip per day.\n\nThe data is unbiased and credible because it is licensed, original, comprehensive, current, and cited. Data privacy is also ensured because there are no issues with personally identifiable information of riders connecting the data to specific riders.\n\nAll datasets to be used were examined to ensure that the column headers in each file were consistent. In addition, each dataset was checked for completeness, accuracy, and format consistency. There were no issues with the data in terms of accuracy or consistency, but there was little information provided on the bike stations for the datasets I was working with. Regardless, the data can be said to have integrity.\n\nFor the purpose of this analysis, current data from the previous twelve months was used: May 2021 to April 2022. For each monthly dataset, there is data under thirteen column headers. These datasets contain data mainly on trip data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-five\"></a>\n# Process\n<a id=\"subsection-eight\"></a>\n#### Pre-cleaning in Excel\nI chose **Excel** for my data cleaning because each file had fewer than a million rows and was an easy first tool to use. I verified the integrity of my data by inspecting all datasets to ensure that the column headers in each file were the same and consistent. In addition, each monthly dataset's data was checked for completeness, accuracy, and format consistency. The following steps were taken to process the data:\n\n**1. Deleting incomplete data**\n\nThe bike data had a lot of incomplete data on the bike stations such as the start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name and end_station_id. Over 500,000 missing bike station data were found using the `COUNTBLANK` function. Thus, all columns of bike station data were deleted. Furthermore, I discovered that data on the latitude and longitude of the stations will be irrelevant for my analysis due to the scarcity of station data. These, too, were removed. In total, nine out of thirteen data columns were relevant for analysis.\n\n\n**2. Cleaning column headers**\n\nAll column headers were cleaned by using the `TRIM` function to ensure that there were no extra spaces and that headers were of a consistent format and naming to make merging easy and smooth.\n\n\n**3. Finding the length of each ride**\n\nFollowing the goal of the business task, it was necessary to calculate the length of each ride in order to make some observations. For each dataset, a new column called \"ride_length\" was added. The following formula was used to calculate this:<br>\n`ride_length = ended_at – started_at (in HH:MM:SS format)`\n\n**4. Finding the day of the week each ride started**\n\nA new column named “day_of_week” was added to each dataset. The goal was to figure out what day of the week each ride began on in order to find useful trends or patterns in the data. The formula below was used:<br>\n`day_of_week = WEEKDAY(started_at)`\n\n**5. Checking for duplicates**\n\nAll datasets were checked for duplicates. There were no duplicates found.\n\n**6. Deleting bad data**\n\nNegative ride length values and blank cells are referred to as bad data in this context. A filter was applied to each column header. Bad data was then filtered out, observed, and removed. Approximately 100 rows of incorrect data were identified and deleted.\n\n**7. Validating the data**\n\nBefore moving on to the next phase, the data was double-checked and cross-examined to ensure that the calculations were correct and that all errors and blank data were removed. Again, filtering was used for the validation.\n\nThe pre-cleaned data can be found <a id=\"subsection-nine\"></a>[here](../input/bike-data).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-six\"></a>\n# Analyse\n\nI used the **R** tool for my analysis, because the data when merged will be too large for Excel to handle. The purpose of this analyse step is to merge the cleaned data into a single data frame, and then conduct analysis to help answer the business task. The following steps were taken to achieve this:\n\n<a id=\"subsection-ten\"></a>\n#### Setting up my environment\nLoading the required packages: `tidyverse` for data import and wrangling, `lubridate` for date functions, `ggplot2` for visualisation and `ggpubr` for plotting scatterplots.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# installing \"ggpubr\"\ndevtools::install_github(\"kassambara/ggpubr\")\nlibrary(ggpubr)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-24T11:52:11.028574Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-24T11:52:11.035548Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-24T11:52:11.516316Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"subsection-eleven\"></a>\n#### Importing my .csv data\nImporting my cleaned [bike-data](../input/bike-data).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# obtaining the filepath representing the current working directory\ngetwd()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-24T11:52:11.519887Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-24T11:52:11.521525Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-24T11:52:11.54704Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# changing from the current working directory to the input directory that contains my uploaded data\nsetwd('../input/bike-data')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-24T11:52:11.550316Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-24T11:52:11.552087Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-24T11:52:11.577334Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# importing my uploaded data\nmay_2021 <- read.csv(\"202105-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\njune_2021 <- read.csv(\"202106-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\njuly_2021 <- read.csv(\"202107-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\naugust_2021 <- read.csv(\"202108-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nseptember_2021 <- read.csv(\"202109-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\noctober_2021 <- read.csv(\"202110-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nnovember_2021 <- read.csv(\"202111-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ndecember_2021 <- read.csv(\"202112-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\njanuary_2022 <- read.csv(\"202201-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nfebruary_2022 <- read.csv(\"202202-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nmarch_2022 <- read.csv(\"202203-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\napril_2022 <- read.csv(\"202204-divvy-tripdata.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-24T11:52:11.581496Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-24T11:52:11.584429Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-24T11:52:42.79623Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Inspecting my imported data\nGetting to know my data by viewing just a small subset of the data, and being acquainted with the column names and data structure.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"head(may_2021)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-24T11:52:42.79974Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-24T11:52:42.802778Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-24T11:52:42.848315Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"colnames(november_2021)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-24T11:52:42.853503Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-24T11:52:42.856549Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-24T11:52:42.87579Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"str(march_2022)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-24T11:52:42.879149Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-24T11:52:42.880664Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-24T11:52:42.909353Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"subsection-twelve\"></a>\n#### Merging all monthly trip data into a single \"trip_data\" data frame","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"trip_data <- bind_rows(may_2021, june_2021, july_2021, august_2021, september_2021, october_2021, november_2021, december_2021, january_2022, february_2022, march_2022, april_2022)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-24T11:52:42.912068Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-24T11:52:42.915224Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-24T11:52:46.620383Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Inspecting my combined data frame","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"glimpse(trip_data)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-24T11:52:46.623009Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-24T11:52:46.624318Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-24T11:52:46.652597Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"subsection-thirteen\"></a>\n#### Wrangling my combined data frame into a new \"bike_data\" data frame\n1.

There is only a 12% difference between them. Thus, if annual members currently are much more profitable than casual riders, then converting casual riders into annual members will increase the company's profitability by a significant margin.\n\n* Weather temperatures and the number of rides recorded are highly positively correlated, therefore majority of rides, approximately 41% of all rides, take place during Summer. This is also the only time of year when casuals ride their bikes slightly more than members.\n\n* Weekday rides make up 68% of all rides, while weekend rides make up only 32%. Weekend rides are dominated by casuals, while weekday rides are dominated by members. Ride volumes are higher for casuals than for members only on weekends.\n\n* The most rides are recorded in the late afternoons and early evenings, with the peak occurring at 17:00 p.m. During the week, members use Cylistic bikes about twice as much as casuals, with peak hours in the early mornings and late afternoons to early evenings. On weekends, casuals use Cyclistic bikes slightly more than members, particularly during peak hours (from the hours of 11:00 a.m. to 18:00 p.m.). Every day at 17:00 a.m., casuals sign up for the bike program.\n\n* Casuals tend to ride for longer periods of time than members. Casuals ride for 70% of the total average ride duration compared to 30% for members.\n\n* Casuals’ ride duration varies from month-to-month; members' are almost constant. There is a fairly even distribution across seasons in terms of overall average ride duration. Overall, there is no strong relationship between monthly average length of rides and monthly number of rides. The relationship between monthly average length of rides and monthly number of rides for casuals is not too strong. Conversely, a stronger relationship between monthly average length of rides and monthly number of rides for members exists.\n\n* Members have a consistent average ride duration across all hours and days. Casuals, on the other hand, have exceptionally long average ride lengths at night, particularly at dawn (00:00 a.m. to 04:00 a.m.). Casuals have high peaks of average ride duration, with an extreme peak value on Tuesdays. Weekend average ride duration is fairly consistent.\n\n* Classic and electric bikes are the most popular types of bikes among both user groups. Members, on the other hand, prefer to ride classic bikes over casuals. A small proportion of casual riders use docked bikes, while none of the members use docked bikes. Nonetheless, docked bikes are used for extremely long periods of time, particularly at dawn.\n\n* Since high average ride duration and docked bikes are highly linked, it implies that the small percentage of casuals who use docked bikes, are those that account for the long average ride hours at dawn.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-eight\"></a>\n# Act\n<a id=\"subsection-twenty-three\"></a>\nThe goal of this phase is to **develop new marketing strategies based on my findings to convert casual riders into annual members.**\n\n<a id=\"subsection-twenty-four\"></a>\n#### Conclusion \nWe can deduce that both user groups use Cyclistic bikes for commuting, recreation, and fitness. Cyclistic bikes could also be used for cycle sport training by a very small percentage of casuals.\n\nMembers primarily use their bikes to commute to work and return home from work on weekdays, resulting in higher ride volumes and consistency regardless of weather temperatures. This could explain why they have two peak hours on weekdays: between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. (when work starts) and 5:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m. (when work ends). They also ride bikes for recreational purposes, or to keep fit. This could explain why they only have one peak period on weekends: 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.\n\nCasuals ride bikes more for recreation (especially during Summer), or to stay fit, which explains their higher ride volumes on weekends and during peak hours from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. They also use bicycles to commute home from work, with peak volumes around 5:00 p.m. on weekdays.\n\nThe small percentage of casual riders who use docked bikes for extended periods of time may be long distance cyclists in the field of sports. They may be responsible for the extremely long ride lengths at night, particularly at dawn (00:00 a.m. to 04:00 a.m.), primarily on Weekdays.\n\nLastly, some users may fail to properly dock or lock their bikes after their trips have ended, resulting in the abnormally long ride duration records. Some may even fail to return the bikes to their designated end stations.\n\n<a id=\"subsection-twenty-five\"></a>\n#### Recommendations\nMy top three recommendations based on the visualisations and findings are:\n\n1. Cyclistic should raise awareness among their subscribers about using Cyclistic bikes as a healthy, eco-friendly mode of transportation. Cyclistic should incorporate vital health statistics of riders, such as ride hours and their associated health benefits, general health information, and so on, into an app feature to encourage users to be more deliberate in their bike use. This will draw more casuals into annual membership.\n\n2. Social ride groups should be formed for users who use bikes for recreational and exercise purposes, with discounts or giveaways available on weekends to those on the membership package. Humans are social beings, so riding bikes in groups while having fun and building profitable connections with others is a key incentive to have casual members decide to become annual members.\n\n3. Special annual membership promotions should be created during Summer. Social media awareness about special price reduction schemes should be heightened months leading up to and during the Summer to keep the users informed. This will entice casuals to become members.\n\n**Bonus Recommendation:**<br>\nAnnual members who consistently use the bike share program and leave reviews should be rewarded with free rides as an incentive to continue subscribing to the program's annual membership. This assists Cyclistic in retaining loyal members and conveys a sense of appreciation and value to loyal annual members.\n\n<a id=\"subsection-twenty-six\"></a>\n#### Further Work\n* More research is needed to determine why some ride lengths are as short as 0s while others are longer than a day, even 38 days.\n\n* It is critical to determine why casuals ride for longer periods of time, particularly at dawn. Additional research should be conducted, and complete data on the start and end stations would be required to help answer this question.\n\n* Furthermore, collecting comprehensive geographical data from start and end stations would provide some more information such as the distribution of rides per area.\n\n* Data on details such as age and gender should be included in the subscription form in order to determine ride distribution across these attributes, which will inform a more targeted marketing strategy.\n\n* More research on casual riders should be conducted via electronic surveys to determine why they prefer to be casuals rather than members. This provides more direct data-driven information.","metadata":{}}]}
